    <p>
      A Tale of Two Cities, novel by Charles Dickens, published both serially
      and in book form in 1859. The story is set in the late 18th century
      against the background of the French Revolution. Although Dickens borrowed
      from Thomas Carlyleâ€™s history, The French Revolution, for his sprawling
      tale of London and revolutionary Paris, the novel offers more drama than
      accuracy.
